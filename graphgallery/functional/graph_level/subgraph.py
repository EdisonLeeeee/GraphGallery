    r"""Create a graph with the specified subset of nodes.
    Exactly one of (nodes_to_remove, nodes_to_keep) should be provided, while the other stays None.
    Note that to avoid confusion, it is required to pass node indices as named Parameters to this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : Graph
        Input graph.
    nodes_to_keep : array-like of int
        Indices of nodes that have to be kept.
    nodes_to_remove : array-like of int
        Indices of nodes that have to removed.

    Returns
    -------
    graph : Graph
        Graph with specified nodes removed.
