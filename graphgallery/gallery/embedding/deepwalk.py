    r"""An implementation of `"DeepWalk" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652>`_
    from the KDD '14 paper "DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations".
    The procedure uses random walks to approximate the pointwise mutual information
    matrix obtained by pooling normalized adjacency matrix powers. This matrix
    is decomposed by an approximate factorization technique.
