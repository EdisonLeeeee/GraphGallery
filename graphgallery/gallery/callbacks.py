    `ModelCheckpoint` callback is used in conjunction with training using
    `model.fit()` to save a model or weights (in a checkpoint file) at some
    interval, so the model or weights can be loaded later to continue the training
    from the state saved.

    A few options this callback provides include:

    - Whether to only keep the model that has achieved the "best performance" so
      far, or whether to save the model at the end of every epoch regardless of
      performance.
    - Definition of 'best'; which quantity to monitor and whether it should be
      maximized or minimized.
    - The frequency it should save at. Currently, the callback supports saving at
      the end of every epoch, or after a fixed number of training batches.
    - Whether only weights are saved, or the whole model is saved.

    Note: If you get `WARNING:tensorflow:Can save best model only with <name>
    available, skipping` see the description of the `monitor` argument for
    details on how to get this right.

    Example(From TensorFlow):

    ```python
    model.compile(loss=..., optimizer=...,
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    EPOCHS = 10
    checkpoint_filepath = '/tmp/checkpoint'
    model_checkpoint_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint(
        filepath=checkpoint_filepath,
        save_weights_only=True,
        monitor='val_accuracy',
        mode='max',
        save_best_only=True)

    # Model weights are saved at the end of every epoch, if it's the best seen
    # so far.
    model.fit(epochs=EPOCHS, callbacks=[model_checkpoint_callback])

    # The model weights (that are considered the best) are loaded into the model.
    model.load_weights(checkpoint_filepath)
    ```

    Args:
        filepath: string or `PathLike`, path to save the model file. e.g.
          filepath = os.path.join(working_dir, 'ckpt', file_name). `filepath`
          can contain named formatting options, which will be filled the value of
          `epoch` and keys in `logs` (passed in `on_epoch_end`). For example: if
          `filepath` is `weights.{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.2f}.hdf5`, then the model
          checkpoints will be saved with the epoch number and the validation loss
          in the filename. The directory of the filepath should not be reused by
          any other callbacks to avoid conflicts.
        monitor: The metric name to monitor. Typically the metrics are set by the
          `Model.compile` method. Note:

          * Prefix the name with `"val_`" to monitor validation metrics.
          * Use `"loss"` or "`val_loss`" to monitor the model's total loss.
          * If you specify metrics as strings, like `"accuracy"`, pass the same
            string (with or without the `"val_"` prefix).
          * If you pass `metrics.Metric` objects, `monitor` should be set to
            `metric.name`
          * If you're not sure about the metric names you can check the contents
            of the `history.history` dictionary returned by
            `history = model.fit()`
          * Multi-output models set additional prefixes on the metric names.

        verbose: verbosity mode, 0 or 1.
        save_best_only: if `save_best_only=True`, it only saves when the model
          is considered the "best" and the latest best model according to the
          quantity monitored will not be overwritten. If `filepath` doesn't
          contain formatting options like `{epoch}` then `filepath` will be
          overwritten by each new better model.
        mode: one of {'auto', 'min', 'max'}. If `save_best_only=True`, the
          decision to overwrite the current save file is made based on either
          the maximization or the minimization of the monitored quantity.
          For `val_acc`, this should be `max`, for `val_loss` this should be
          `min`, etc. In `auto` mode, the mode is set to `max` if the quantities
          monitored are 'acc' or start with 'fmeasure' and are set to `min` for
          the rest of the quantities.
        save_weights_only: if True, then only the model's weights will be saved
          (`model.save_weights(filepath)`), else the full model is saved
          (`model.save(filepath)`).

    r"""Callback for creating simple, custom callbacks on-the-fly.

    This callback is constructed with anonymous functions that will be called
    at the appropriate time (during `Model.{fit | evaluate | predict}`).
    Note that the callbacks expects positional arguments, as:

    - `on_epoch_begin` and `on_epoch_end` expect two positional arguments:
      `epoch`, `logs`
    - `on_batch_begin` and `on_batch_end` expect two positional arguments:
      `batch`, `logs`
    - `on_train_begin` and `on_train_end` expect one positional argument:
      `logs`

    Args:
        on_epoch_begin: called at the beginning of every epoch.
        on_epoch_end: called at the end of every epoch.
        on_batch_begin: called at the beginning of every batch.
        on_batch_end: called at the end of every batch.
        on_train_begin: called at the beginning of model training.
        on_train_end: called at the end of model training.

    Example(From TensorFlow):

    ```python
    # Print the batch number at the beginning of every batch.
    batch_print_callback = LambdaCallback(
        on_batch_begin=lambda batch,logs: print(batch))

    # Stream the epoch loss to a file in JSON format. The file content
    # is not well-formed JSON but rather has a JSON object per line.
    import json
    json_log = open('loss_log.json', mode='wt', buffering=1)
    json_logging_callback = LambdaCallback(
        on_epoch_end=lambda epoch, logs: json_log.write(
            json.dumps({'epoch': epoch, 'loss': logs['loss']}) + '\n'),
        on_train_end=lambda logs: json_log.close()
    )

    # Terminate some processes after having finished model training.
    processes = ...
    cleanup_callback = LambdaCallback(
        on_train_end=lambda logs: [
            p.terminate() for p in processes if p.is_alive()])

    model.fit(...,
              callbacks=[batch_print_callback,
                         json_logging_callback,
                         cleanup_callback])
    ```
